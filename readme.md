## Treehouse's Odot App Preconfigured With A Laravel Console

After completing Treehouse's Laravel Basics course I was looking for a way to keep improving my knowledge of PHP within a Laravel environment. I was also curious about in-browser consoles at the time. I did a google search, found Darsain's Laravel Console package, and decided to install it into the odot application.

The result is a simple (if slightly incomplete) todo list application that has a page routed to the console package. You can use the console to test blocks of PHP and Blade code. It's also great for performing database queries without placing code in your actual app. I hope you find this as useful as I am. Enjoy :D

## Documentation

There are only two routes in the application. '/' is the index route will take you to the todo list index page. '/console' is the console route, and it will take you to the console. No configuration needed. Just clone it, plug, and play. If you want to install a console into your own app, check out Darsain's laravel-console package. It's no more than a few steps
